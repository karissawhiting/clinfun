   o fixed bug in print.gsdesign for binomial case (p1,p2 instead of pC,pE)
   o ROC functions now check that there are at least one each of status=0,1

04/27/2011:  Version 0.9.7

   o fixed fortran code to address gfortran-4.6 warnings

04/07/2010:  Version 0.8.8

     only one treatment exceeds the min.resp threshold.

07/10/2009:  Version 0.8.5

   o Changed the Jonckheere-Terpstra statistic such that large value is 
     indicative of increasing group locations and small for decreasing.
     Function warns that p-value is based on approximation for tied data.

12/02/2008:  Version 0.8.4

   o Added functionality to pselect.  It can do unequal sample size for 
     the case of two treatments.  min.diff can be specified as a rate 
     instead of number of responses.  Output element names changed to be
     more descriptive.

11/18/2008:  Version 0.8.3
